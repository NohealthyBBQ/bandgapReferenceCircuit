# ee272b
repository for a bandgap voltage reference in SKY130 technology

# prerequisites
it's assumed that you've installed ngspice, skywater-pdk, Xschem_sky130, and Xschem. if you're missing one of these, please follow the steps in [this video](https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/xschem_man/video_tutorials/install_xschem_sky130_and_ngspice.mp4).

the written documentation for Xschem is available [here](http://repo.hu/projects/xschem/xschem_man/xschem_man.html)

# design blocks
the bandgap circuit is compact and the entire design is contained in the following file  
`schematics/tsmc_bandgap_real.sch`
